> "We harness the transformative power of info-communications technology and related engineering, to deliver user-centric services for Singapore and Singaporeans. We want you to be part of our vision to establish Singapore as a Smart Nation, a nation of possibilities empowered through technology."

### **Our People – Lead the Growth**

Our people are our greatest assets and form the “heart-ware” of all we do. We embrace that learning is never done. We are constantly challenged to sharpen our professional skill sets and to take charge of our own development. We live and breathe our ABC values.

### **Our Work - Build What Matters**

> We build products and solve problems that improve our citizens’ lives! We take initiative and self-organise to deliver results. We don’t let processes get in the way, rather we use them to scale the impact of our work and aren’t afraid to change how things are done, to work smarter and use time more efficiently.

### **Our Heartbeat**

We prioritise the well-being of YOU and are committed to help you feel refreshed and fulfilled both in and out of work, without losing sight of what matters to you.
